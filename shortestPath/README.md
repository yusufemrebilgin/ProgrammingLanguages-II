# Recursive Shortest Path Homework

*Let MxN be a matrix of 0 and 1 values. Write the C program that finds the shortest path from 0x0 to MxN point. 1 values in the matrix represents the path while 0 represents the wall. So you cannot go to the coordinate or position with 0 value. You can move in four directions in total. Up, down, left and right. Below is an example path.*
